Exercise: 
You’re going to do some software development for a company called Very Dirty Manufacturing, Inc. (VDMI). 
VDMI prides itself with being able to take on the most environmentally damaging manufacturing jobs (dirty) 
in the most environmentally responsible way possible (clean).
Of course, VDMI gets paid big bucks for taking on such legally risky work, but the firm is also dedicated 
to preventing any of its employees from injury due to the work. The managers are so dedicated to the health 
and well-being of their workforce that they plan on having their industrial hygiene (IH), occupational health 
(OH), and safety records available on the Internet for public viewing (more on what IH and OH are about in 
just a moment).
Your job is the development of the worker demographics subsystem for maintaining the IH, OH, and 
safety records for VDMI. Internally, management will need to review worker data by the following:
•	 Organization in which a person works
•	 Location where the employee works
•	 Job and tasks the employee performs while working
For IH, environmental samples will be taken in the areas where people work to make sure they 
are not being exposed to hazardous chemicals or noise without the right protections in place. For 
OH, workers who do work in dirty areas will be under regular medical surveillance to make sure that 
they are not being harmed while doing their work. And last, any accidents involving workers will also 
be documented so that no similar accidents take place, and to ensure that the workers are properly 
compensated for their injuries.
Externally, the sensitivity of the information will prevent the company from identifying for whom 
the data presented exists, but the information will still be presented by the high-level organization, 
location, and job. Therefore, the same demographic data and its relationship to workers in the firm need 
to be in place.
